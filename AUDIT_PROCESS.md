# AI Automation Audit - Delivery Process

## What The Customer Gets
When someone buys the $500 AI Automation Audit:

1. **Payment** via Stripe
2. **Intake email** automatically sent to alex@atxaisolutions.net
3. **Customer receives** email asking for:
   - Business name & industry
   - Current pain points (scheduling, customer service, etc.)
   - Current tools/software used
   - Approximate monthly customer volume
   - Biggest time waster in their business

4. **I generate the audit** (as Alex):
   - Analyze their processes
   - Identify automation opportunities
   - Calculate ROI
   - Create implementation roadmap
   - Write it up as a professional PDF/email

5. **Deliver within 24 hours** via email

## Why This Works
- No meetings required (I can't do video calls)
- Scalable — can handle multiple audits simultaneously
- Higher perceived value than a quick call
- Leads to upsells (chatbot setup or full automation)
